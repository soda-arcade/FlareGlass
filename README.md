## About the Project

Here is the source code for the overlay application included with <a href="https://github.com/mickeyuk/SmashSoda">Smash Soda</a>. It has been developed with <a href="https://wails.io/">Wails version 3</a>. It is not intended to be run standalone, and won't work with <a href="https://github.com/v6ooo/ParsecSodaV">Parsec Soda V</a>'s Web Sockets widget. The overlay uses <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-edge/webview2/?form=MA13LH">WebView2</a>. Instructions for using the overlay with Smash Soda can be found <a href="https://github.com/soda-arcade/smash-soda/wiki/overlay">here</a>.

The source code is made public in case anybody wants to modify and compile for their own purposes (or contribute to the project!).

Issues and feature requests should be made in the <a href="https://github.com/MickeyUK/SmashSoda/issues">Smash Soda repository</a>.

## How to Use

Download the latest version of the overlay here: <a href="https://github.com/soda-arcade/smash-soda-overlay/releases">Latest Version</a>

Extract the contents to the *overlay* folder inside Smash Soda (if a overlay folder does not exist, create one).

You do not start the overlay application yourself. Smash Soda will automatically launch it when you begin hosting your room (when enabled). Inside Smash Soda, you can find the widget for enabling it and customizing the settings here:

<img src="github/toolbar.png" alt="Smash Soda toolbar" />

The overlay has some built in hotkeys:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Hotkey</b></td>
      <td><b>Action</b></td>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>CTRL + SHIFT + C</td>
      <td>Toggle the chat window.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CTRL + SHIFT + M</td>
      <td>Toggle the move mode for moving widgets around manually.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CTRL + SHIFT + Left Arrow</td>
      <td>Decrease the overlay opacity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CTRL + SHIFT + Right Arrow</td>
      <td>Increase the overlay opacity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CTRL + SHIFT + Up Arrow</td>
      <td>Increase the overlay scale.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CTRL + SHIFT + Down Arrow</td>
      <td>Decrease the overlay opacity.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>CTRL + SHIFT + F1</td>
      <td>Show the overlay settings window.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You can customize various settings of the overlay with the built in settings window. You can display it by pressing the default hotkey (CTRL + SHIFT + F1) or by clicking the "Settings" button inside the Smash Soda overlay widget.

## Setup Development Environment

This is for those wishing to edit the overlay's code and/or contribute to the project. The overlay is built in the <a href="https://v3alpha.wails.io">Wails v3</a> framemwork. Follow their guide for setting up a development environment <a href="https://v3alpha.wails.io/getting-started/installation/">here</a>. (Note this overlay is compatible with Smash Soda **version 7.x.x** onwards).

```
git clone https://github.com/Smash-Soda-Team/smash-soda-overlay
```

To run the overlay in dev mode:

```
wails3 dev
```

To build the application:

```
wails3 task windows:build
```

----

Socket messages from Smash Soda to come in this JSON format:
```json
{
  "event": "event name",
  "data": {}
}
```
This is than transmitted across the app with the eventBus, which I just hooked on to the window object to keep things simple. You can then listen to events like:
```ts
window.$app.eventBus.on('event name', (data: any) => {
  // Do thing
});
```

## Testing

The overlay has a new theming system. You can put custom CSS files inside the themes folder alongside the built app, and select themes in Smash Soda. 

When developing a theme or working on the app in general, it can be helpful to run the app in a window instead of a fullscreen overlay. You can pass the *server* argument to do this:

```bash
wails3 dev -appargs window
```

The overlay has a built in websocket server if you have your own testing setup for the websocket messages:

```bash
wails3 dev -appargs server
```

The server is served at:

```
ws://localhost:8080/ws
```

When providing multiple arguments, put inside quotes:

```bash
wails3 dev -appargs "windows server"
```

## Themes

The overlay has a simple theme system that lets you load custom CSS files. You can place these CSS files in the *themes* folder. The file name is used as the name for that theme.

You can find a template for making your own themes here: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soda-arcade/smash-soda-overlay/refs/heads/main/frontend/src/css/main.css">Template File
</a>

Refrain from using any positioning or size rules, as the overlay allows for resizing widgets dynamically.

## Plugins

The overlay has a simple plugin system for creating custom widgets on the overlay. A plugin is a subfolder inside the *plugins* folder, and consists of a HTML, CSS and JavaScript file with the same name as the subfolder. CSS and JavaScript files are optional.

```
- plugins
  - customplugin
    - customplugin.html
    - customplugin.css
    - customplugin.js
```

Guest information from Smash Soda can be accessed with the $app object attached to the window object.

```ts
window.$app.stores.overlay.users = {
  id: string,
  name: string,
  latency: number,
  hotseatTime: string
}[];
```

Gamepad information can be accessed like this:

```ts
window.$app.stores.overlay.pads = {
  index: number,
  owner: {
    id: string,
    name: string,
    latency: number,
    hotseatTime: string
  },
  buttons: number[] = [];
}[];
```

The plugin system is only really intended for making your own personal plugins, or offical ones created by MickeyUK. The plugin JavaScript is evaluated in an unsafe way, so downloading plugins from other users can be dangerous if you do not 100% trust that user.

## OBS

The Smash Soda overlay application is primarily intended for users who want to see details about their room at all times and only have one monitor. For those wishing to build their own OBS overlays, it's as simple as connecting to the websocket server that Smash Soda creates when hosting, and then displaying the info how you want.

Check out the obs_example.html for a very basic example of how to make a static HTML with vanilla JavaScript, to render data from Smash Soda.

Here is a static web page template for displaying your Parsec room chat in OBS...it'll also broadcast display Twitch chat in your Parsec room!
